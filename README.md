## Next steps (what I can do for you)

1. **Pin your best 4–6 repos** — I can suggest which ones to pin and how.
2. **Generate a polished README** for one repo (screenshots, run instructions, badges).
3. **Create badges** (build, license, coverage) and add GitHub cards.
4. **Improve repository topics & descriptions** for discoverability.

*How to edit this profile README:* Create a repo named exactly `Abdullahjamal9` and commit this `README.md`. You can edit text directly on GitHub or clone locally and push changes.

Good work — open this file and edit the placeholders (email, project descriptions, screenshots). Once you're happy, we'll move to Step 2: pinning repos and improving an individual project README.
